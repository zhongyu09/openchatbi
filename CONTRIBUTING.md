# Contributing to OpenChatBI
Hi there! Thank you for your interest in contributing to OpenChatBI.

OpenChatBI started as a personal project, with the hope of making it easier for businesses to build their own ChatBI applications with less effort. To achieve this goal, I made it open source, and I greatly appreciate contributions of all kinds.

Whether youâ€™d like to propose a new feature, refactor the code, enhance documentation, or fix bugs, your contributions are always welcome.
